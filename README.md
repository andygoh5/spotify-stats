I found out that you can request a copy of your streaming data of the past year from Spotify
from:  
https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/account/privacy/

Once they send you the data, it will unzip into a folder called "MyData". Add this folder into the repository, and run the code.

Right now, you can see your
- Top artists from the past year
- Top artists from 2022
- 2022 Spotify wrapped (so far)  

Or you can search for a specific artist or song.
